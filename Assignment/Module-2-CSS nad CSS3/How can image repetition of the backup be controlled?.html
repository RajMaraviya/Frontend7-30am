     Using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image.
     The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically.
     It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.

     E.g :
        body{
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-repeat: repeat;
            background-repeat: repeat-x;
            background-repeat: repeat-y;
        }
